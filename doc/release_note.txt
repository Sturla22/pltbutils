pltbutils release_note.txt

alpha0003 December 02, 2013
1. Added a line feed before printing the test name for clarity,
   in procedure testname() in pltbutils.vhd .
2. Added functions to_ascending(), to_descending() and hxstr()
   in pltbutils.vhd (not yet included in the specification).
3. check() in pltbutils.vhd now outputs hexadecimal values instead of
   binary values for std_logic_vector, unsigned and signed.
4. Updated tb_example.vhd, tc_example.vhd and tc1.vhd to feed
   the generic G_DISABLE_BUGS to tc1. 
   The message "Bug here somewhere" is now only output when
   G_DISABLE_BUGS=0.

   The inverted clock output can be used when a differential
